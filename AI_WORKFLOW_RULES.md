# AI Workflow Rules for VNCompare.com

## üéØ Primary Rule: Always Reference AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

**CRITICAL**: Before performing ANY task on this project, you MUST:

1. **Read** the `AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` file first
2. **Understand** the current project structure and business logic
3. **Reference** the appropriate sections for your task
4. **Update** the `AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` file after completing any significant work

## üìã Workflow Process

### Before Starting Any Task

1. **Read AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Get full project context
2. **Identify** which application(s) are affected (web, admin, backoffice, api)
3. **Check** existing patterns and conventions
4. **Plan** your approach based on the documented architecture

### During Development

1. **Follow** established patterns and conventions
2. **Maintain** consistency across all applications
3. **Test** critical business logic (coverage calculator, address validation)
4. **Document** any new patterns or conventions

### After Completing Work

1. **Update** `AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with any changes made
2. **Add** new features, patterns, or important notes
3. **Update** the "Last Updated" timestamp
4. **Ensure** the file remains the single source of truth

## üîç Key Areas to Always Check

### Business Logic

- **Coverage Calculator**: Paint quantity calculations (m¬≤/liter)
- **Vietnam Address System**: Provinces, districts, wards
- **Price Calculations**: Base price + shipping + taxes
- **Shipping Zones**: Complex geographic calculations

### Technical Architecture

- **Monorepo Structure**: Multiple apps with Turbo
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma (web) and Doctrine (API)
- **Authentication**: JWT for API, NextAuth for web
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query (web), NgRx (admin)

### Critical Files

- `apps/web/`: Next.js frontend
- `apps/admin/`: Angular admin panel
- `apps/backoffice/`: Additional backoffice
- `apps/api/`: Symfony API backend
- `AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: Project context and guidelines

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

### Always Validate

- Vietnam addresses using the proper administrative divisions
- Coverage calculations with real-world paint specifications
- Price calculations including all components
- Authentication and authorization across all apps

### Maintain Consistency

- Follow established naming conventions
- Use consistent patterns across applications
- Keep documentation up to date
- Test critical business logic thoroughly

### Update Documentation

- Add new features to AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Update architecture diagrams if needed
- Document new patterns or conventions
- Keep the "Last Updated" timestamp current

## üö® Critical Business Rules

### Coverage Calculator

```
Paint Needed (liters) = Total Area (m¬≤) √∑ Coverage Rate (m¬≤/liter) √ó Number of Coats
```

### Price Calculation

```
Total Price = Base Price + Shipping Cost + Taxes + Additional Fees
```

### Vietnam Address Hierarchy

1. Province (T·ªânh/Th√†nh ph·ªë) - 63 total
2. District (Qu·∫≠n/Huy·ªán) - Within provinces
3. Ward (Ph∆∞·ªùng/X√£) - Within districts

## üìù Documentation Standards

### When to Update AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

- Adding new features or components
- Changing architecture or patterns
- Adding new dependencies or tools
- Modifying business logic or calculations
- Updating deployment or configuration

### What to Include

- Clear descriptions of new features
- Updated architecture diagrams
- New patterns or conventions
- Important business rules
- Critical technical decisions

## üîÑ Regular Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks

- Review and update AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Check for outdated information
- Ensure all new features are documented
- Verify critical business logic is accurate

### Before Major Releases

- Comprehensive review of AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Update all architecture diagrams
- Verify all business rules are current
- Ensure deployment instructions are accurate
